# Random_processes_course
Implemented random processes within the framework of academic assignments from the university. 
Description of tasks:
- Modeling data distributions - implementation of a uniform distribution number generator. On the basis of a uniform distribution, making a normal distribution. Creating a sample from the values of Kolmogorov statistics for 100 simulated normal distributions.
- Modeling and analysis of the Markov process - modeling and implementation of the Markov process with three states. Verification of the fulfillment of the central limit theorem and the law of large numbers.
